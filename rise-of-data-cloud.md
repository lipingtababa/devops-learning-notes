Technologies
1. Performance: 
    1. Use cloud's unlimited resources to do parallel computing. 
    2. Separate storage and computing.
2. Simplicity: 
    1. Support SQL 
    2. Support self-service 
    3. Keep a single version of data
3. Initially, MySQL was used before it was replaced by FoundationDB for performance reasons.

Challenges, Courage and Solutions:
1. It required lots of courage to run a DB exclusively on public clouds back in 2013. However, public cloud was needed for performance.
2. Before snowflake was released, AWS introduced Redshift in 2012. However, the snowflake team stop panicking after realizing that redshift was a traditional DB migrated to the cloud, rather than re-architected for the cloud. 
3. Snowflake hires sales before releasing the product. Sales team shared meeting minutes with everyone as valueable feedbacks.
4. Sales team uses linkedin and hiring ads to find out the potential customers. They also target adtech companies.
